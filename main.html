    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. An efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity.

        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total memory space required by an algorithm to run completely, including input, variables, and function calls. An example is O(n), which denotes linear growth of memory with input size.
